# Desktop Mate (Artie)

A delightful, interactive desktop companion that lives on your screen. Built with C++ and Qt 6.

## 🌟 Features

Artie is more than just a static image; he's a lively character with his own behaviors:

*   **Physics-Based Movement**: Artie obeys gravity, falls when dropped, and walks along the bottom of your screen.
*   **Autonomous Behavior**: He decides when to walk, change direction, or stand still and observe.
*   **Interactive**:
    *   **Drag & Drop**: Pick him up with your mouse (Left Click) and toss him around.
    *   **Customization**: Right-click to access a context menu where you can change his size (Small, Normal, Large) or arm style (Thin, Thick, Red).
    *   **Gestures**: Press `W` to make him wave at you!
*   **Always on Top**: He stays visible over your other windows, keeping you company while you work.

*   **C++ Compiler** (supporting C++17)
